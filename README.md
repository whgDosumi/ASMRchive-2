# ASMRchive-2
A re-creation of my ASMRchive project using better practices.

## WIP
Currently working on building CI, and designing the overall structure of the project.

Current plan is to have three containers. 
- Postgres database
- Python service for scanning and downloading ASMR (and database migrations)
- Express node.js webserver
